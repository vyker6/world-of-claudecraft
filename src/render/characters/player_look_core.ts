// What a PLAYER wears: the one rule that turns a stored/wire appearance into a
// composed ModularLook, for every surface that draws a character the player
// designed: the world, the char-select stage, the roster portrait chip, the
// redesign editor's turntable.
//
// It lives here rather than in the app coordinator because it is a rendering
// rule (which parts, over which kit, with the helm on or off), and because
// keeping it DOM-free and three-free makes it directly unit-testable
// (tests/player_look_core.test.ts). The coordinator's job shrinks to supplying the
// two things only it knows: which armour set to preview, and where the
// appearance came from.
//
// The armour set is a PARAMETER on purpose. The local player honours a
// per-class localStorage override (a dev knob) and peers must not: reading that
// store here would drag localStorage into a core that has no business touching
// it, and would silently dress every peer in whatever set this machine last
// picked.

 *     the look itself is unchanged, so the common case has to resolve here
 *     without ever reaching a stringify.

 *     (whose field is undefined, never explicitly null) does not spuriously
 *     compare unequal to itself.
 *  3. Only then a value comparison, delegated to `sameAppearance`
 *     (src/world_api/appearance.ts): its JSON.stringify shortcut is sound
 *     here because both sides are documents produced by the same sanitizer,
