// The line-count RATCHET for the repo's known monolith files. Module-first is the
// doctrine (root CLAUDE.md, Modularity): new logic lands as its own sibling module
// behind an existing seam, and the coordinator files below must never GROW. Between
// v0.30.0 and v0.36.0 every sanctioned coordinator grew anyway and several new
// monoliths formed, so the doctrine gets a deterministic gate: each named file has a
// ceiling a little above its size when this gate landed. Exceeding the ceiling fails
// the suite.
//
// How to respond to a failure here:
// - The fix is EXTRACTION, not raising the ceiling: move the new logic into a sibling
//   module behind the file's seam (listed per row below; recipe in the
//   extract-and-test skill, .claude/skills/extract-and-test/) and import it.
// - After a real extraction shrinks a file, LOWER its ceiling to the new size plus a
//   small margin in the same change; the ratchet only works if it tightens.
// - Raising a ceiling is a maintainer decision: do it only when a change genuinely
//   cannot land behind a seam, keep the raise small, and justify it in the PR body.
// - A missing file usually means it was split or renamed: update or remove its row in
//   the same change so the gate tracks the real tree.
//
// Data-as-code is exempt by design (src/sim/content/, the i18n catalogs and matcher
// DICTs, generated artifacts): those tables are correctly large. This gate names only
// LOGIC files.

    // reach the ability list; the toggle beside it would have closed it instead.
    // castCrossHotbarAction is the other: it routes a pad press back through
    // castSlot so a cross-hotbar cast keeps the SAME semantics a key press has
    // (reticle, empower, sport, mouseover) instead of growing a second cast path,
    // with the Attack branch beside it: Attack is the fixed slot-0 toggle rather
    // than an ability, so it is the one action the seed cannot copy off the bar.
    // Raised for the cross-hotbar cast-fallback fix: the fallback grows an item
    // arm and a spoken refusal beside the ability one, and the shared item-use
    // seam castSlot and the pad now both call. Exact merged count, zero slack:
    // any further growth reds again.
    // Re-pinned across the third release/v0.40.0 sync into the bank-storage

    // the two lines it bought are banked rather than spent.

    // whole body (the markup lookup, the slot-element minting, the attack /
    // slot / page-toggle wiring and both view constructions) moved behind the
    // action_bar seam into hud/action_bar/mobile_action_ring_controller.ts, and

    // and useConsumableSlot (the markup lookup, the slot-element minting, the
    // toggle/slot wiring, the tooltip binding and the view construction) moved
    // behind the action_bar seam into hud/action_bar/consumable_seat_controller.ts,

    // as the ring above: an extraction lowers the ceiling in the same change.
    // Exact count, zero slack.
    // LOWERED 19263 -> 19078 by the touch bar editor: the mobile long-press
    // rearrange (the MobileHotbarDrag type, the field, clearMobileHotbarDrag,
    // bindMobileActionDrag, bindMobileRingDrag and the two point-to-slot hit
    // tests) is DELETED, and the overlay that replaces it lives in
    // hud/action_bar/bar_editor/. Hud kept only the window construction, its two
    // mutation callbacks and the public opener, so the file lands 185 lines
    // below its old pin even after the wiring. Exact count, zero slack.
    // LOWERED 19078 -> 19076 by the bar editor's Clear control: the desktop
    // slot's two shift-clear listeners moved behind action_bar_clear.ts's own
    // bindShiftClear, and the editor's three mutation callbacks now share ONE
    // tooltip hide inside the window, which pays for the new clearSlot callback
    // with two lines to spare. Exact count, zero slack.
    // LOWERED 19076 -> 19052 by the touch stance radial: renderStanceBar's whole
    // body (the row's markup, its per-button tooltip and click wiring, and the
    // signature latch) moved behind a new hud/stance seam, and Hud kept the
    // one-line frame call plus the callback bag the module is built with. The
    // ratchet's own rule: an extraction lowers the ceiling in the same change.
    // Exact count, zero slack.
    // Upstream lowered the SAME pin twice on its own arm: the Reliquary-tracker
    // input construction moved into makeReliquaryTrackerInput
    // (reliquary_tracker_view.ts), and the stale-focus Space fix (PR #3506)
    // moved the chrome focus wiring (the tracker drops plus the panel key-guard
    // loop) into src/ui/chrome_focus_wiring.ts, leaving hud.ts a one-line
    // consumer (wireChromeFocus($)). The pin below is the MERGED reality of both
    // arms of extraction. Exact count, zero slack: any further growth reds again.
    // LOWERED 19038 -> 19032 by the touch review fixes: the action-bar tooltip's
    // in-bags sub-line moved into hud/action_bar/item_bags_line_core.ts, which
    // the consumables row's restored item tooltip shares, and paid for its own
    // two callback lines with nine to spare. Exact count, zero slack.
    // LOWERED 19032 -> 19031: the bar editor's swapSlots/clearSlot callbacks now
    // share placeAbility's spellbook-refresh through one commitHotbarActions
    // helper, fixing a stale assign toggle when a bound spell is cleared or
    // swapped with the spellbook open behind the editor. Exact count, zero slack.
    // Re-pinned across the FOURTH release/v0.40.0 sync into the bank-storage
    // branch (the touch UI rework). Both arms extracted on their own base: the
    // release took hud.ts to 19031 across the radial ring, consumables seat, bar
    // editor, stance radial and the review fixes above; the branch sat at 19496
    // with its bank chrome. Both land in the merged tree, so the exact merged
    // count is the honest zero-slack bound, and it LOWERS the branch pin by 445.
    // LOWERED 19051 -> 19035 by Bank Storage phase 15. The store's open-window
    // refresh needs a line on the slow band and this file had zero slack, so it
    // is paid for by an extraction the same phase owns: the daily-rewards /
    // store launcher POLL (sequence guard, throttle stamp, fetch chain) moved
    // into src/ui/daily_rewards_launcher_core.ts beside the predicate it already
    // called, the ClaudiumLauncherBalance shape this file already composes. The
    // headroom the move bought is BANKED, not spent.
    // Re-pinned at the FIFTH release/v0.40.0 sync into the bank-storage branch
    // (the Exchange / marketplace release). Both arms moved on their own base:
    // the release took hud.ts to 18688 across the wallet-verify extraction and
    // the PR 3606 review deletions, while the branch sat at 19035 with its bank
    // and store chrome. Both land in the merged tree, so the exact MERGED count
    // is the honest zero-slack bound. Re-derived from the merged tree, never
    // taken from either side.
    // Re-pinned at the SIXTH release/v0.40.0 sync (release tip 9a89e3483e). The
    // release's own arm grew hud.ts 18688 -> 18694; this branch sat at 18692.
    // The merged count is exactly base plus BOTH arms' deltas, which is the
    // proof neither side's lines were dropped. Exact merged count, zero slack.
    // Re-pinned at the release/v0.41.0 sync into the bank-storage branch (the New
    // Eastbrook program, which retires the Vale Cup and demolishes the Sowfield).
    // The release arm DELETES more than this branch adds, so the merged count lands
    // below the branch pin and the ratchet follows it DOWN. Measured on the merged
    // tree, never reconciled by arithmetic. Exact count, zero slack.
    // Re-derived at the PR #3670 review-fix round. Against the release/v0.41.0
    // base (18488) this file is +3: the bank-storage feature's own store and
    // vault chrome wiring (the earlier notes about merged-tree arithmetic
    // described branch history that the squash rebased away). The review round
    // itself paid its Escape-rung addition by merging duplicate imports. The
    // raise is this PR's REQUEST, not a settled ruling: merging is what
    // ratifies it. Exact count, zero slack.
    // Re-pinned at the second release/v0.41.0 sync (release tip b02da096dd, the
    // Exchange balance + client-perf batch). The release arm added the wallet
    // card's onWalletChanged fan-out and the refreshWocBalance(force) hook and
    // paid both lines by trimming the Exchange-window comment, so its arm and
    // the merged tree both net zero against this row. Measured on the merged
    // tree, never reconciled by arithmetic. Exact count, zero slack.
    // Re-pinned at the fourth release/v0.41.0 sync (release tip 8592df3866).
    // The release arm carries two hud-heavy batches of its own: the PR #3284
    // interface-unlock merge (raised, then partially taken back by the
    // review-round extraction into the pure core interface_unlock_menu_core.ts;
    // what remains on coordinator state, the dimension-mode mover wiring, the
    // edit-preview painter closure and the player-frame bar lock, is the
    // live-hooks half) and the snap-grid / edit-cursor rework under PR #3714.
    // This branch's arm stays its +3 store and vault chrome. Measured on the
    // merged tree, never reconciled by arithmetic. Exact count, zero slack.
    // Re-pinned at the fifth release/v0.41.0 sync (release tip ddc8988185,
    // the gamepad empower-hold batch). The release arm lowered its own pin
    // by 2 when the charge state and the XHB slot lookup moved to
    // src/ui/empower_hold_core.ts; this branch's arm stays its +3 store and
    // vault chrome. Measured on the merged tree, never reconciled by
    // arithmetic. Exact count, zero slack.
    // Re-pinned at the sixth release/v0.41.0 sync, now on the PR 3676 arm: the

    // round two caught, and the comments for both), which is why the honest

    // the degrade rule are unit-tested there now), and the charter fit memory
    // (the server's refusals plus the last painted ladder count, which

    // (That comment's own next target, the spin/wheel overlay, SHIPPED in Bank
    // Storage phase 17; the current one is named at the end of this row.)
    // LOWERED 1331 -> 1329 at the fifth release/v0.40.0 sync. The release moved
    // the dollar formatting into src/ui/usd_text.ts and this file's three call
    // sites became one-liners, so the merged file is two lines smaller than the
    // branch pin. The ratchet only works if it tightens after an extraction,

    // LOWERED 1329 -> 1306 by Bank Storage phase 17, in two goes. The spin/wheel

    // (src/ui/daily_rewards_spin_view.ts) and a thin painter
    // (src/ui/daily_rewards_spin_controller.ts, named for the suffix the painter
    // gate sweeps, so the cold contract this code held inside the window came
    // with it), which paid for the store's error-body focus fix. Then the
    // phase's review round spent that room and more, so the rank panels
    // (leaderboard and payout history) followed to
    // src/ui/daily_rewards_ranks_view.ts rather than the ceiling going up: a
    // raise is a maintainer decision, and the fixes were paid for the way
    // everything else in the phase was.
    //
    // LOWERED AGAIN 1306 -> 1281 in the same phase's fix-round review, which found
    // the error-body reachability claim wrong and cost three lines to correct in

    // its review round is doing its job.

    // the rewards tab still built inside the window.

    // ownership and prompt invalidation moved to store_surface_runtime.ts, and
    // the full guarded skin purchase flow moved to store_armory_purchase.ts.

    // builders that read purchase state at build time.
